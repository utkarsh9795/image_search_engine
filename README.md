![Image Search Engine](path_to_your_image.png)

## Overview

The **Image Search Engine** is a web application that allows users to search for high-quality images using the Unsplash API. This project showcases a simple yet powerful interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to find and display images based on their queries. Each search returns a grid of images, and users can load more images by clicking the "Show More" button, fetching an additional 12 images at a time.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can input keywords to search for images.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded dynamically as the user clicks "Show More," improving performance.
- **Integration with Unsplash API**: Leverages the Unsplash API to fetch high-quality, royalty-free images.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions and API calls.
- **Unsplash API**: Provides access to a vast collection of images.
